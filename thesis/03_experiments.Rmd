# Experiments {#sec:experiments}

Here go some experiments, for example the average speed in the cars data set is `r mean(cars$speed)`.

You can also produce tables directly from R code:

```{r tables-mtcars, echo=FALSE}
# kable produces nice table output  
#  - see ?kable 
#  - see also package `kableExtra` 
#  - booktabs (LaTex package) makes the table look even nicer
#  - longtable (LaTex package) is required for better floating control

knitr::kable(iris[1:5, ], caption = 'A simple table.', booktabs = TRUE, longtable = TRUE) 
```
